### Data access

To reproduce the analysis, download the data archive from the following link and extract it into the project repository:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J7PJCp5XGBhDvD5L94hkOkobt2kBOoA_/view?usp=sharing

After extraction, the data directory should contain two subfolders: `aesthetic/` and `unaesthetic/`.

Ensure that the extracted data folder is named `data` and contains the two subfolders `aesthetic/` and `unaesthetic/`.
